To add a new API source for jokes there is 3 steps which need to be taken.

1)
In /src/APIs, create a new .PHP file titled "API" followed by the number of which API it is. 
Currently, there is 3 set API's. If you wish to include an API then the filename "Api4" is what it should be called.

2)
In /src/apiRan.PHP on line 3, increase the $max variable to match the amount of APIs in the system. 
If you added one, then change the $max=3; to $max=4;

3)
In /src/apiRAN.PHP after line 12, create a new elseif statement. 
This statement should identify the variable $num as equal to the number assigned to the API you have added. 
Within the IF statement you should then add an include function which is set to the location of the new API added. 
If a new API has been added then the elseif statement would follow as such: elseif ($num == "4") { include ('src/api4.php'); }
